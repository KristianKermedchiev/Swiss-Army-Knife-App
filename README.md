# Swiss-Army-Knife App ✅  
My new years' resolution was to be more disciplined with my exercises, finances and studies. I have built this lightweight CLI-based app to help track day-to-day tasks, studies, habits and more. I decided to make it a full CLI app with the commands in the style of UNIX to become more comfortable with the CLI in general and to have that sweet dopamine when I finish a task and log it in my command line each day. In version 2 I decided to add the GUI feature to better visualize the data stored in the .json files.

## 🔹 How to Use  the CLI
After running `Swiss-Army-Knife-App-CLI.exe`, you can use the 'help' or '?' commands to be presented with a list of commands that are available. Typing "help 'command'" will show the full usage of the command. The app does not use any database and does not require an internet connection. For each type of record that is made by the app will create a .json file at the same location as the .exe which will be used to store data for the given module, i.e. bills.

## 🔹 How to Use  the GUI
After running `Swiss-Army-Knife-App-GUI.exe`, you can browse the tabs and filter based on various criteria the data stored in the .json files. The expenses tab contains additional feature for deeper analysis on the data via pie and graph charts as well as monthly comparison of the data.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting  
1. **Windows Defender Blocking the App?**  
 - If Windows Defender warns you, click **More Info > Run Anyway**.
2. **Missing Data Files?**  
 - The app creates JSON files in the same directory as the executables, so I recommend to keep everything in one folder.  
 - If deleted, they will be recreated when you run the app, but all data will be lost.
